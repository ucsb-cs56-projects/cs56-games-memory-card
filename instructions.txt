Goal:

Match all pairs of cards to go to next level 
before the time runs out.

Instructions:

There are 3 levels.

Click a card to flip the card.

If the cards do not match, the cards will 
flip back after a few seconds (this time 
will decrease as the level increases). 

If the cards match, the cards will stay flipped.

If all of the cards are flipped before the time 
runs out (this time also changes as the level 
changes), you will win the level and move on 
to the next one.

The number of cards on the grid would also 
change based on the level.

Good Luck!









(Cheat: click on the card on (0,1) twice)
