Goal:

Match all pairs of cards to go to 
next level before the time runs out.

Instructions:

There are 3 levels.

Click a card to flip the card.

If the cards do not match, the 
cards will flip back after a few 
seconds (this time will decrease 
as the level increases). 

If the cards match, the cards will 
stay flipped.

If all of the cards are flipped 
before the time runs out (this 
time also changes as the level 
changes), you will win the level 
and move on to the next one.

The number of cards on the grid 
would also change based on the level.

Good Luck!









(Cheat: click on the card on (0,1) twice)
