Fixes:
1) README.txt is really vague. It only states what type of game it is and essentially does nothing else.

2) Instructions are unappealing.

3) Resets score when you select play again after beating the game.

4) The images on block 0-1 are displayed without the grey filter that they usually have.

5) When you reset, it clears the score but does not send the user back to the original level. Either needs to reset and stay on level but keep the score, or reset and take the user to the beginning.

6) ~~HighScores needs javadoc comments and Junit tests, the code is messy.~~ Issue #14

7) ~~Need to remove commas in High-Score names. Also, Add Junit testing for it.~~ Issue #14

8) ~~Need simple, comma separated values in high score format.~~ Issue #14

9) Dialogue boxes are unclear. Issue #14

10) ~~build.xml is outdated and will complete run and compile commands but will not create a javadoc.~~
