1. Card matching game, click the cards to reveal them and click two of the same to permanently reveal them.
2. As a player I can click cards so that they reveal their icon. As a player I can click two matching cards to permanently reveal them. As a player I can play the game and save my highscore. As a player I can click instructions and be given a instruction screen of how to play the game.
3. The software runs except for a few brief freezes. It generates a board of x * x amount of cards and waits for you to click.
4. As a player I should be able to access the highscores and instructions without being spammed with pop-ups. As a player I should be able to finish a level and see some sort of progression animation so I know when I have finished a level.
5. The basic information is present, there is nothing detailed or project history. Notes present on not recommending this project for future students as it is well built and almost done.
6. As far as we can tell nothing needs to be updated. It builds properly and there are no noticeable issues. Nothing old to remove either.

8. The code is divided into multiple java files, each one accomplishes a task given by the name of the file. Within each file, there are comments present on each method, contructor, and variable to tell the reader what the thing does. Honestly, for any future workers on this project, you can easily digest what everything does in this project. Only thing lacking in the comments is HighScoreBoard.java. Nothing to really fault the old programmers on.
9. There are a decent chunk of tests, cover a lot of common things and the most used methods and constructors. Could have added more and future workers on this project can add more JUnit test cases if desired. If future test cases were to be added, I would expand the situations the tests cover and make sure every method is tested.
