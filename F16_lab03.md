1. Memory Card Game is a game that flips two cards each time to find matching pairs before time runs out.
2. As a player I can click start/resume to start the game and to get the timer going/starting. As a player I can click a card to flip it and see which picture it has. As a player I can click two matching cards to earn score and to permanently flip the card until that round is over. 
3. The software runs except there are glitches here and there. It starts the game with x by x number of cards.
4. As a player it might be more fun to play with more difficulties. As a player I could see some animation after I finish a level.
5. The README.md tells you a brief description about the game, and that this project is well-built in terms of logic and design. It would be better if README.md has details about how many cards the player starts with and how to flip cards. Also, screenshots of the cards might be useful and more descriptive.
6. The build.xml file does not have any targets that need descriptions, or old legacy JWS stuff that needs to be removed.
7. There are enough issues to earn 1000 points by working on this project. The expectations to how the issues should be fixed are clear.
8. There are no issues added because this is a switched repo.
9. The code is in different files with names that straight-forwardly tell what each file does. The purposes of classes and the methods are clear and the code structure is well-built. There are issues here and there but overall, the code is pretty easy to comprehend. There are different files for making grid, using grid, using GUI, instruction screen, exceptions, etc.. 
10. There are tests, but they do not cover every possible situations. They cover constructors, methods, and different random cases. There can be more JUnit tests.
